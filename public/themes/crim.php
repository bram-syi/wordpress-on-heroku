$TEMPLATE->post_content = "I'm a fan of the Crim Foundation because it inspires our community to be healthier and happier. Their annual Festival of Races is an amazing event that encourages people to get in shape and have fun through friendly competition. Crim also provides a 15-week adult training program leading up to the festival that helps participants get in shape, stay motivated, and connect with other aspiring athletes.

We can sponsor someone in our community by donating a scholarship that covers the cost of the training program, and gives him or her the leadership and support he or she needs. Please join me to spread the health!";
