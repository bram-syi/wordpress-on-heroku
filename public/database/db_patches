# How to write a DB patch?
#=========================
#
# A DB patch is a single if { } block in this file.
# A sample commented patch is shown below.
#
# Two utility functions, get_current_version() and set_version()
# are readily available from this script for your use.
# More functions can be made available if needed.
#
# There is no need to connect to the database. The database handle
# is stored in a special variable called '$dbh' and is available
#
# Please call set_version() at the end when all sql pertaining 
# to the patch has been executed and it is time to update the 
# database version. 
#
# The patch author may assume that his/her patch is being run
# in a transaction. Calling set_version() commits the transaction.
# 
# Example: Here is a sample DB patch.
#
# if (get_current_version($dbh) < 2) {
#     my $bar = do_something();
#     my $user = 'gijoe';
#     my $sth = $dbh->prepare("UPDATE wp_users WHERE user = ?");
#     $sth->execute($user); 
#     $dbh->set_version(2);
#  }
#
# Note that get_current_version(), set_version() and $dbh are not defined in this file.
# This code is called from apply_db_patches.pl which executes the patches listed here.
